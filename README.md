# DnDCharacterCreator
A text-based DnD character creation project in Java. 
This was the first "big" (I thought so at the time) project I worked on as a Freshmen Computer Science student. It was the final project of my
CPSC 1110: Data Structures and Program Design class. I have not gone back to refactor this code as of yet in order to use better programming practices, make it more efficient, etc., so bear with me. I've also uploaded the class UML with this. Probably not the best design but once again, that was my Freshmen year.
